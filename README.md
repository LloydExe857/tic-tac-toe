# Overview

This is a two-player tic-tac-toe game made in Java. It alternates turns, adds symbols to spaces, and checks victory conditions.

This program was written to help me learn and solidify my understanding of the Java language.

# Future Work

I'm pretty proud of what I've done here, but there are a couple of things I might do in the future to improve the program, including:
* Add more of the program functionality to the Board class, such as the gameWon function and having changing a space value be a Board method, rather than calling setSpaceValue in Main
* Put the spaces within the game board in a two-dimensional array
